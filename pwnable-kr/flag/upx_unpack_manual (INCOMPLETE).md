## Purpose

This writeup serves to document the steps taken to manually unpack the UPX-packed `flag` binary into the output `flag_manually_unpacked` binary for future reference, as well as for a quick recap of a small tidbit of how executable packers work. 

## Reference

Steps were taken from [this page on dissecting manually unpacking a UPX-packed file](https://tech-zealots.com/reverse-engineering/dissecting-manual-unpacking-of-a-upx-packed-file/).
