# Welcome Note

Welcome to my public CTF repo! 

I am Teong Seng (you can call me TS), and I am a rising sophomore at UCLA :)

> **TODO** Reminder to myself to update this description as I (supposedly) go through the grades. 

This repo's currently not very populated right now, but as I solve more challenges, hopefully things will get better. 

## What is there to see?

For now, the most interesting subdirectory is probably the picoGym Pwn folder. Access the README for that folder [here](./picoCTF/Pwn/README.md). 

In my opinion, the Pwn challenges in the [LACTF 2024 folder](./LACTF%202024/) are worth a glance too. 

## Current Pursuit(s)

Currently working on [picoGym's Pwn challenges](./picoCTF/Pwn/),  and I plan to work on pwnable.kr challenges too!
