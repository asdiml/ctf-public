# 🧑‍💻 Teong Seng's Public CTF Repo

Welcome to my public CTF repo! 

I am Teong Seng (feel free to call me TS), and I am a sophomore studying Computer Science & Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles. 

I enjoy playing 🖥️🔓 **Capture-The-Flag competitions** 🔓🖥️, and this is my public CTF repository of solves, writeups and links to resources that I found useful. My favorite category is *Pwn*, or Binary Exploitation. 

If you are into CTFs too, shoot me a friend req on 📲 [Discord](https://discord.com/users/369738823929823233) and let's play together!

## ✏️ Challenge Writeups ✏️

I solved a large number of Pwn challenges listed on 🏋️‍♂️picoGym🏋️‍♂️, and the index of writeups for these challenges can be found [here](./picoCTF/Pwn/README.md)

The [no_handouts](./buckeyeCTF_2024/no_handouts/README.md) and [sailing_the_c](./buckeyeCTF_2024/sailing_the_c/README.md) challenges in the Buckeye CTF 2024 folder are worth a look too, in my opinion. 

## 📖 Resources 📖

In the [resources](./Resources/) folder are some notes, as well as links to pages I found useful, such as 
- a cheatsheet about the ELF format (linked in [this document](./Resources/Pwn/Linux_Pwn/elf.md))
- [notes](./Resources/Pwn/Windows_Pwn/windbg_notes.md) on using WinDbg

and more. 

## 🏃‍♂️ Current Pursuits 🏃‍♂️

Currently working on solving [pwntable.tw challenges](./pwnable-tw/)
